# Stuff

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. Flutter will be the front end of this application and will house all of the UI. Flutter helps develop for both iOS and Android at the same time. If you are using a windows device then android will be the emulator to use and if you are developing on a mac then you can use either android or iOS emulators.

## Suggestions

### Brew

Before you start installing anything, IF you are on mac I highly suggest using Brew. Brew is a package manager for macs and its amazing. Pretty much you can use it to easily install stuff onto your computer. Check it out

- [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

### Git

Git is a version control system that will allow us to work independently. We are using github btw.

The main branch is what houses code that works. When you are working on something new you want to branch off of the main branch and into a feature branch. In the feature branch you can do all of your testing and development. Once you are ready you can open a pull request from your feature branch into the main branch. Before a PR can be merged, it needs some to review.

### VS Code

I reccomend using VS Code as your IDE but feel free to use what ever you like. Android studio is pretty decent since it has all of the emulators you will need. Ask me what plugins I use.

Use brew to install if not link is below
